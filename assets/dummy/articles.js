        'content' : '<p>With some caveats, the iPhone was a capable — nay — pleasurable holiday companion. Before leaving for Japan this gone December I considered buying a new camera, but realised I also needed a new phone. I thought back to by 2015 trip on which I used a Lumix GX7, which was great, but remembered certain difficulties: uploading photos was time (and data) consuming and Geo-tagging was difficult and buggy.</p>\r\n<p>None of the cameras I would consider this time around really solved these issues so I used the excuse to get the (second) best iPhone money could buy. Before embarking I was also looking at several apps. Let me skip the details of this and announce that I quickly settled on the native camera app (for ease of use), ProCamera (for low light or hero shots) and VSCO for edits.</p>\r\n<p>This was most useful in non-challenging situations. Raise the phone and swipe and you’re ready so snap. There were limitations in low light — and in certain low-detail situations the compression tended to make things like skies super blotchy, which was frankly at times unbelievable considering the touted effort that goes into the camera software. This was a compromise, and if I thought a shot might be a cosmetic keeper, I’d whip out ProCamera.</p>\r\n<p>This app has a couple of neat features that are hard to ignore. Firstly, it uses both lenses, the 50 and 28 (equivalent), to create a higher definition photo than either could make, and it really works. Shooting in low light like this also yields better results than you’d expect.</p>\r\n<p>The exposure compensation in this app is also very useful at night. I’m posting a couple of shots below taken with both these features, and edited with VSCO.</p>\r\n<p>In the shot below you can see some dynamic range limitation. Not sure if they HDR kicked in, I found it did so less often when using this iPhone than with my 6.</p>\r\n<p>If you need a fine detail of control over your shots, beyond say setting exposure compensation, then you probably want physical dials.</p>'

        'content' : '<p>With some caveats, the iPhone was a capable — nay — pleasurable holiday companion. Before leaving for Japan this gone December I considered buying a new camera, but realised I also needed a new phone. I thought back to by 2015 trip on which I used a Lumix GX7, which was great, but remembered certain difficulties: uploading photos was time (and data) consuming and Geo-tagging was difficult and buggy.</p>\r\n<p>None of the cameras I would consider this time around really solved these issues so I used the excuse to get the (second) best iPhone money could buy. Before embarking I was also looking at several apps. Let me skip the details of this and announce that I quickly settled on the native camera app (for ease of use), ProCamera (for low light or hero shots) and VSCO for edits.</p>\r\n<p>This was most useful in non-challenging situations. Raise the phone and swipe and you’re ready so snap. There were limitations in low light — and in certain low-detail situations the compression tended to make things like skies super blotchy, which was frankly at times unbelievable considering the touted effort that goes into the camera software. This was a compromise, and if I thought a shot might be a cosmetic keeper, I’d whip out ProCamera.</p>\r\n<p>This app has a couple of neat features that are hard to ignore. Firstly, it uses both lenses, the 50 and 28 (equivalent), to create a higher definition photo than either could make, and it really works. Shooting in low light like this also yields better results than you’d expect.</p>\r\n<p>The exposure compensation in this app is also very useful at night. I’m posting a couple of shots below taken with both these features, and edited with VSCO.</p>\r\n<p>In the shot below you can see some dynamic range limitation. Not sure if they HDR kicked in, I found it did so less often when using this iPhone than with my 6.</p>\r\n<p>If you need a fine detail of control over your shots, beyond say setting exposure compensation, then you probably want physical dials.</p>'

        'content' : '<p>With some caveats, the iPhone was a capable — nay — pleasurable holiday companion. Before leaving for Japan this gone December I considered buying a new camera, but realised I also needed a new phone. I thought back to by 2015 trip on which I used a Lumix GX7, which was great, but remembered certain difficulties: uploading photos was time (and data) consuming and Geo-tagging was difficult and buggy.</p>\r\n<p>None of the cameras I would consider this time around really solved these issues so I used the excuse to get the (second) best iPhone money could buy. Before embarking I was also looking at several apps. Let me skip the details of this and announce that I quickly settled on the native camera app (for ease of use), ProCamera (for low light or hero shots) and VSCO for edits.</p>\r\n<p>This was most useful in non-challenging situations. Raise the phone and swipe and you’re ready so snap. There were limitations in low light — and in certain low-detail situations the compression tended to make things like skies super blotchy, which was frankly at times unbelievable considering the touted effort that goes into the camera software. This was a compromise, and if I thought a shot might be a cosmetic keeper, I’d whip out ProCamera.</p>\r\n<p>This app has a couple of neat features that are hard to ignore. Firstly, it uses both lenses, the 50 and 28 (equivalent), to create a higher definition photo than either could make, and it really works. Shooting in low light like this also yields better results than you’d expect.</p>\r\n<p>The exposure compensation in this app is also very useful at night. I’m posting a couple of shots below taken with both these features, and edited with VSCO.</p>\r\n<p>In the shot below you can see some dynamic range limitation. Not sure if they HDR kicked in, I found it did so less often when using this iPhone than with my 6.</p>\r\n<p>If you need a fine detail of control over your shots, beyond say setting exposure compensation, then you probably want physical dials.</p>'

        'content' : '<p>With some caveats, the iPhone was a capable — nay — pleasurable holiday companion. Before leaving for Japan this gone December I considered buying a new camera, but realised I also needed a new phone. I thought back to by 2015 trip on which I used a Lumix GX7, which was great, but remembered certain difficulties: uploading photos was time (and data) consuming and Geo-tagging was difficult and buggy.</p>\r\n<p>None of the cameras I would consider this time around really solved these issues so I used the excuse to get the (second) best iPhone money could buy. Before embarking I was also looking at several apps. Let me skip the details of this and announce that I quickly settled on the native camera app (for ease of use), ProCamera (for low light or hero shots) and VSCO for edits.</p>\r\n<p>This was most useful in non-challenging situations. Raise the phone and swipe and you’re ready so snap. There were limitations in low light — and in certain low-detail situations the compression tended to make things like skies super blotchy, which was frankly at times unbelievable considering the touted effort that goes into the camera software. This was a compromise, and if I thought a shot might be a cosmetic keeper, I’d whip out ProCamera.</p>\r\n<p>This app has a couple of neat features that are hard to ignore. Firstly, it uses both lenses, the 50 and 28 (equivalent), to create a higher definition photo than either could make, and it really works. Shooting in low light like this also yields better results than you’d expect.</p>\r\n<p>The exposure compensation in this app is also very useful at night. I’m posting a couple of shots below taken with both these features, and edited with VSCO.</p>\r\n<p>In the shot below you can see some dynamic range limitation. Not sure if they HDR kicked in, I found it did so less often when using this iPhone than with my 6.</p>\r\n<p>If you need a fine detail of control over your shots, beyond say setting exposure compensation, then you probably want physical dials.</p>'

        'content' : '<p>With some caveats, the iPhone was a capable — nay — pleasurable holiday companion. Before leaving for Japan this gone December I considered buying a new camera, but realised I also needed a new phone. I thought back to by 2015 trip on which I used a Lumix GX7, which was great, but remembered certain difficulties: uploading photos was time (and data) consuming and Geo-tagging was difficult and buggy.</p>\r\n<p>None of the cameras I would consider this time around really solved these issues so I used the excuse to get the (second) best iPhone money could buy. Before embarking I was also looking at several apps. Let me skip the details of this and announce that I quickly settled on the native camera app (for ease of use), ProCamera (for low light or hero shots) and VSCO for edits.</p>\r\n<p>This was most useful in non-challenging situations. Raise the phone and swipe and you’re ready so snap. There were limitations in low light — and in certain low-detail situations the compression tended to make things like skies super blotchy, which was frankly at times unbelievable considering the touted effort that goes into the camera software. This was a compromise, and if I thought a shot might be a cosmetic keeper, I’d whip out ProCamera.</p>\r\n<p>This app has a couple of neat features that are hard to ignore. Firstly, it uses both lenses, the 50 and 28 (equivalent), to create a higher definition photo than either could make, and it really works. Shooting in low light like this also yields better results than you’d expect.</p>\r\n<p>The exposure compensation in this app is also very useful at night. I’m posting a couple of shots below taken with both these features, and edited with VSCO.</p>\r\n<p>In the shot below you can see some dynamic range limitation. Not sure if they HDR kicked in, I found it did so less often when using this iPhone than with my 6.</p>\r\n<p>If you need a fine detail of control over your shots, beyond say setting exposure compensation, then you probably want physical dials.</p>'

        'content' : '<p>With some caveats, the iPhone was a capable — nay — pleasurable holiday companion. Before leaving for Japan this gone December I considered buying a new camera, but realised I also needed a new phone. I thought back to by 2015 trip on which I used a Lumix GX7, which was great, but remembered certain difficulties: uploading photos was time (and data) consuming and Geo-tagging was difficult and buggy.</p>\r\n<p>None of the cameras I would consider this time around really solved these issues so I used the excuse to get the (second) best iPhone money could buy. Before embarking I was also looking at several apps. Let me skip the details of this and announce that I quickly settled on the native camera app (for ease of use), ProCamera (for low light or hero shots) and VSCO for edits.</p>\r\n<p>This was most useful in non-challenging situations. Raise the phone and swipe and you’re ready so snap. There were limitations in low light — and in certain low-detail situations the compression tended to make things like skies super blotchy, which was frankly at times unbelievable considering the touted effort that goes into the camera software. This was a compromise, and if I thought a shot might be a cosmetic keeper, I’d whip out ProCamera.</p>\r\n<p>This app has a couple of neat features that are hard to ignore. Firstly, it uses both lenses, the 50 and 28 (equivalent), to create a higher definition photo than either could make, and it really works. Shooting in low light like this also yields better results than you’d expect.</p>\r\n<p>The exposure compensation in this app is also very useful at night. I’m posting a couple of shots below taken with both these features, and edited with VSCO.</p>\r\n<p>In the shot below you can see some dynamic range limitation. Not sure if they HDR kicked in, I found it did so less often when using this iPhone than with my 6.</p>\r\n<p>If you need a fine detail of control over your shots, beyond say setting exposure compensation, then you probably want physical dials.</p>'

        'content' : '<p>With some caveats, the iPhone was a capable — nay — pleasurable holiday companion. Before leaving for Japan this gone December I considered buying a new camera, but realised I also needed a new phone. I thought back to by 2015 trip on which I used a Lumix GX7, which was great, but remembered certain difficulties: uploading photos was time (and data) consuming and Geo-tagging was difficult and buggy.</p>\r\n<p>None of the cameras I would consider this time around really solved these issues so I used the excuse to get the (second) best iPhone money could buy. Before embarking I was also looking at several apps. Let me skip the details of this and announce that I quickly settled on the native camera app (for ease of use), ProCamera (for low light or hero shots) and VSCO for edits.</p>\r\n<p>This was most useful in non-challenging situations. Raise the phone and swipe and you’re ready so snap. There were limitations in low light — and in certain low-detail situations the compression tended to make things like skies super blotchy, which was frankly at times unbelievable considering the touted effort that goes into the camera software. This was a compromise, and if I thought a shot might be a cosmetic keeper, I’d whip out ProCamera.</p>\r\n<p>This app has a couple of neat features that are hard to ignore. Firstly, it uses both lenses, the 50 and 28 (equivalent), to create a higher definition photo than either could make, and it really works. Shooting in low light like this also yields better results than you’d expect.</p>\r\n<p>The exposure compensation in this app is also very useful at night. I’m posting a couple of shots below taken with both these features, and edited with VSCO.</p>\r\n<p>In the shot below you can see some dynamic range limitation. Not sure if they HDR kicked in, I found it did so less often when using this iPhone than with my 6.</p>\r\n<p>If you need a fine detail of control over your shots, beyond say setting exposure compensation, then you probably want physical dials.</p>'
