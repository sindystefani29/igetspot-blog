        'content' : '<p>On good days, Dr. Sarah Sharp gets to watch living North Atlantic Right Whales. The school-bus sized, dark creatures, with scoop-like mouths and white spots on their face, sometimes launch themselves out of the water, like leaping ballerinas. They will breach and play with each other, a behavior once thought to be a mating display, but was later found to take place outside of the mating season. It is likely the animals are just socializing, having fun with the other whales.</p>\r\n<p>Sharp also enjoys watching them feeding peacefully. &ldquo;They literally just mow the grass underwater with their mouths open, filter feeding with their baleen, getting all the little crustaceans out of the water column,&ldquo; Sharp explained. &ldquo;Its kind of a zen like experience to watch these animals, going so smoothly along, just under the water surface.&ldquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sebagai tokoh bisnis yang dikenal sangat mendukung kemajuan perusahaan-perusahaan karya merah putih untuk maju di kancah internasional, Pak Boy berbagi visi yang sama dengan kami. Membuat Indonesia menjadi pesaing di ranah global,&rdquo; imbuhnya, dalam keterangannya, Rabu (24/7).</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, Dr. Sharp, a veterinarian and marine mammal stranding coordinator at the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), mostly looks at dead whales. And none of the whales she has studied in the last 16 years died a natural death after a long life.</p>\r\n<p>Sharp is the lead author of a recent study published in the journal Diseases of Aquatic Organisms. The study, spearheaded by the International Fund For Animal Welfare, focused on determining causes of death for North Atlantic right whales between 2003 and 2018.</p>\r\n<p>When a North Atlantic right whale dies, they sometimes wash ashore, or are found out at sea, floating in the water. When someone reports an animal, a scientist can perform a necropsy, or animal autopsy, to try and figure out how the creature died. The researchers who provided data for this study found the cause of death of 43 whales. 88 percent, or 38 animal deaths, were human-caused. The study doesn’t include 2019 deaths — in June alone, six more North Atlantic right whales have been found dead.</p>\r\n<p>16 animals from the study died from ship strikes. 22 died from getting entangled in fishing gear. That means fishing gear alone killed more than half of North Atlantic right whales, out of the ones whose deaths we know the cause of, in the past 16 years.</p>\r\n<p>The charismatic creatures, with complex social lives, integral roles in their environments, and majestic displays, are down to about 400, with fewer than 100 breeding females left alive. Once boldly leaping from the water, now the animals are too often found dead, propeller marks on their backs or fishing gear wrapped around their faces, limbs and tails. Dead in the most painful and unnecessary ways.</p>'

        'content' : '<p>With a dynamic culinary scene, Washington, D.C., is rapidly becoming a top-tier destination for visitors looking for unique and varied veg options in the home of politics, iconic monuments, and free museums. Restaurants in D.C. are focused on providing diners with healthier options and crafting menus that highlight local and seasonal produce, and some, like NuVegan and Fare Well, concentrate on changing the notion of what it means to be vegan by creating seriously good plant-based takes on comfort foods like mac and cheese and barbecue wings.</p>\r\n<p>D.C. was ranked the 11th-best destination for vegans and vegetarians in a 2018 study that evaluated the diversity, accessibility, and quality of vegan and vegetarian options in 100 major cities across the United States. And it shows: From the vegan soul food to the baked goods to the delectable array of international dining options, the nations capital has more incredible foods to discover every day.</p>\r\n<p>For a perfect holiday exploring urban green spaces, enjoying chill jazz festivals, boating along the Potomac River, and filling up on veg-friendly treats, here is a cheat sheet to help anyone make the most out of a weekend in the District.</p>\r\n<p>Juicing and a healthy, plant-based lifestyle played a significant role in keeping founder Annette Turner cancer free for almost 10 years. Her juice bar and vegan restaurant, Turning Natural, eventually expanded from its original Forest Hills location after her daughter Jerri Evans took over the business in 2010 with the mission of providing underserved communities across the district with access to healthier dining and take-out options. In addition to cold-pressed juices and smoothies with catchy names like Bromelionaire, J Coal, and Green Latifah, Turning Natural also offers a dining menu with favorites including the black bean burger, as well as colorful açaí and pitaya bowls.</p>\r\n<p>Just one stop away from Anacostia on the green line metro brings you to Navy Yard, a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood where the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail, a 28-mile recreational area around the river, begins. Previously one of the most polluted rivers in the nation, the Anacostia has seen a change in recent years after repeated cleanup efforts and sewage upgrades. Yards Park, a micro development of the broader southeast Navy Yard community, is home to running and bike paths, picnic areas, and a slew of restaurants, coffee shops, and bars, not to mention local shops like Steadfast Supply, which offer made-in-D.C. items for sale. In the spring and summer, the Ballpark Boathouse offers a chance to explore the city by water with kayak and canoe rentals.</p>\r\n<p>Rasa Grill is a bright, fast-casual Indian restaurant offers flavorful Indian dishes that come in two options. Enjoy one of the pre-made dishes with quirky names like &ldquo;Aloo Need is Love,&ldquo; composed of sweet potato cutlets and charred eggplant served over a bed of lemon turmeric rice, roasted lentils, and a drizzle of spicy coconut-ginger sauce. Or do it yourself by choosing your own base — which includes super grains like ragi, rice noodles, and salad greens — along with protein, toppings, and a sauce to meld it all together. Indian flavors even dominate the drinks menu with creative cocktails like masala gin and tonic and tamarind margaritas. Location: 1247 First St SE, Washington, D.C. 20003</p>'
